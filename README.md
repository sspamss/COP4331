## Description
Contactasaurus is a specialized personal contact manager for museum managers to keep track of their employees.

Each new user will need a login. If a user does not already own an account, a sign-up block will prompt up. Otherwise, they can proceed to sign-in. Each user will be able to create their own contacts in which they can delete, edit, and search for for their contacts as needed.
